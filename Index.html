            <h1>Jacob Nolting</h1>
            <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; color: brown">Software Engineering Student</p>
            <p>I am currently a student at Iowa State University studying Software Engineering.<br>
            I spent the first 5 semesters of college at Kirkwood Community College before transfering to Iowa State to finish my major.</p>

        <div class="project">
            <h3 style = "margin-bottom: 0px">Text based Python game</h3>
            <h1 class="pType">Personal</h1>
            <p>This project was my first introduction to programming. I programmed this game in Python as a way to test my skills in Python. The game is a text based rpg style game that changes based on the decisions you make in the game.</p>
            <h3 style = "margin-bottom: 0px">Animated Java rpg game</h3>
            <h1 class = "pType">Personal</h1>
            <p>Similar to the Python game, I developed this game to push myself to learn more about programming. I developed this game using Java. I also created and implemented numerous animations to go along with this game. The game features complex backend processes to track, change, and use the various behind the scenes effects that the player will encounter.</p>
            <h3 style = "margin-bottom: 0px">Java Music game</h3>
            <h1 class = "pType">School</h1>
            <p>This game was a group project for one of my classes at Kirkwood. Students were placed in groups of four and instructed to create a game in Java using the scrum and agile methods of developement that we learned over the semester. My group and I made a music game that gave you points based on how close to the beat you were able to jump. I mostly worked on the backend for this project.</p>
